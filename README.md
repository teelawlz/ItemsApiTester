# ItemsApiTester
A little UI for making API calls to the WoW Items database

## The Gist
* Enter your item id number
* Specify region
* Go

The output pretty-printed below the controls and gave users a glimpse of a WoW item in glorious json.


Sadly, this no longer works as the API is no longer publicly available.
